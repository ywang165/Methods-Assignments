This assignment takes you through the process of writing your first bash script using Emacs in your VM.

0. Launch a `Terminal` window
   0. Done [WYW]
0. Enter the command `emacs -nw` which will launch the emacs text editor inside the terminal window
   0. Done [WYW]
0. Create a new file by hitting C-x C-f (that's short for CTRL-x followed by CTRL-f)

   * Emacs will pop up a little `minibuffer` at the _bottom_ of the terminal saying `Find file:`

   * This is its way of asking you the filename you want to use 

   * Give it a filename `First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh`

0. As the first line of the script, enter the exact letters `#!/bin/bash`
   
   0. Done [WYW]
   * This is the magic spell that identifies the file as a bash script file

0. Now hit return a couple of times and write `echo "Hello world!"`
   0. Done [WYW]

0. Hit `C-x C-s` (Control-x followed by Control-s) to save the file 

0. Hit `C-x C-c` to exit from Emacs
   0. Done [WYW]

0. In the `Terminal` shell, type `cd /~` to change the directory to the home directory `/~` where you created the file

0. Before the file can be executed, it must be marked as executable.
   0. Done [WYW]
   * This is done using the `chmod` command (short for `change the modification characteristics of the file`)

   * The specific command you must use is `chmod a+x *.sh` 

   * The `*.sh` syntax means `all files ending in .sh`

0. Now you should be able to execute the file in either of two ways:

   0. Type `/bin/bash First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh`

   0. Type `./First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh`

0. Capture the magnificent results of your efforts in an output file by adding ` > First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].out` after typing one of the above options to execute the .sh file. For example,

   `./First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh  > First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].out`

0. View the results in two ways:
   0. Done [WYW]

   0.  At the shell type `cat *.out`

      * The `cat` command gives a `catalog` of the contents of the files that are its argument 

      * Since there is only one file ending in `.out` the catalog has only your program's output

   0. Open the file using the command `emacs First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].out`

      * You will notice that this time, Emacs opens as a graphical application in its own window

      * The reason is that your previous invokation of emacs included the `-nw` flag, which is short for `no window` and has the effect of launching emacs inside the shell window

0. Move your results to your `/shr` folder:

   0.  In the `Terminal` shell, type `mkdir -p /home/methods/Dropbox/shr/Methods/Assignments/03-20_Write-Your-First-Bash-Script-Using-Emacs_[Moniker]`

      * The `mkdir` command with the `-p` flag creates the directories needed to generate the specified folder structure

   0.  Figure out how to move your `First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].sh` and `First-Bash-Script-[Moniker].out` files from the home directory `/~` to the directory created above with the `mkdir` command

      * This is done in the `Terminal` shell.  Hint:

	0. The command to move files is `mv`
